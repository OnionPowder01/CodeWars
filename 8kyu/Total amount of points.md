## Total amount of points

**Definition**

Our football team finished the championship. The result of each match look like "x:y". Results of all matches are recorded in the collection.

For example: ["3:1", "2:2", "0:1", ...]

Write a function that takes such collection and counts the points of our team in the championship. Rules for counting points for each match:

if x > y: 3 points
if x < y: 0 point
if x = y: 1 point

```Notes:
there are 10 matches in the championship
0 <= x <= 4
0 <= y <= 4
```

### Solution

```python
def points(games):
        total = 0
        for i in games:
            if int(i[0]) > int(i[-1]):
                total += 3
            elif int(i[0]) == int(i[-1]):
                total += 1
        return total
```
